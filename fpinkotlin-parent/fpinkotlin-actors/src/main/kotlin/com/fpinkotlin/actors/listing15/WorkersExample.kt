/**
 * This is a version of the actor example using Kotlin coroutines. Kotlin coroutines offer
 * an implementation of the Channel concept which is an important part of the Actor concept.
 * Actors are basically channels plus mutable state (what we called "behavior" in the present
 * example). In this implementation, we use Kotlin channel for serialized communication. What
 * this means is that we made the minimal changes to the example in order to use coroutines.
 * In the next listing, we'll see how the same problem can be handle in a more Kotlin idiomatic
 * way.
 *
 * This version uses our immutable Heap. Look at listing16 and listing17 for faster versions
 * using Kotlin data structures.
